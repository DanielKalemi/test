 ~ This PROGRAM is part of the final project in CS 105 ~
 * SUBJECT: CS-105: Introduction to Programming I
 * TITLE: FINAL PROJECT- 7 MENU OPTION
 * 
 * DATE: 27/11/2017   (ACADEMIC YEAR 2017-2018- FALL SEMESTER)
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION: This program displays to the user 7 menu options, each of them calculating & presenting different exercieses
 * Menu Option 1:  This option Calculates and displays the Sum, Product, Variability and Standard Deviation from 6 integers that the user has inputed.
 * Menu Option 2:  This option Calculates and displays the factorial of the integer closest to the group's average of the 5 user-input numbers.
 * Menu Option 3:  This option Calculates the Sum, Product, Variability and Standard Deviation of all the prime numbers between 0 and 30.
 * Menu Option 4:  This option Asks the user to guess a random number between 0 and 100.
 * Menu Option 5:  This option Displays 7 unique Pythagorean Triples from within the limit of 120.
 * Menu Option 6:  This option Calculates all betrothed number integer pairs between 0 and 10000.
 * Menu Option 7:  Exit the program.
 * 
 * THIS CODE USES A DO-WHILE LOOP TO REPEAT THE PROGRAMS UNTIL USERS PRESS 7 FOR EXIT
 * ALSO IN THIS CODE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MENU OPTION IS BUILT BASED ON IF-ELSE STATEMENTS
 * THE EXCERCIESES HAD DIFFERENT WAYS TO SOLVE THEM, BUT I TRIED TO COMBINE THEM, FROM THE LONGEST WAYS, TO ARRAYS AND ALSO A METHOD IMPLEMENTED IN THE SIXTH OPTION.
